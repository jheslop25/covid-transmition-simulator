# covid-19-simulator
#
# This project is intended to be an amateur first exploration of disease modeling. 
# It feels like a very relevant concept to become at least passingly familiar with 
# these days. This is by no means scientifically rigorous nor do I play a doctor on TV.
# This is a simple client side SPA that does not at this time rely on any real world data.
# In essence this is a simple math based simulator for considering how the relative values 
# of various factors like social distancing and restricted movement affect the propagation of 
# an infectious disease through a population of "agents". Have fun, adjust the parameters, post the results.
#  
# If you have an idea to make this better, feel free to open a PR.
# 
# Cheers!
